# What is Luax?

 Luax is a easy-to-learn, powerful, modern programming language. ([Chinese Page](./doc/doc-zh/README.md))

 Luax provides full documentation(from the language itself to internal design), making it a perfect project for beginner to learn how to make a *interpreter*.

 Luax is distributed in source code, which contains the c-achieved interpreter, standard library, a standalone executable interpreter, a syntax-standardlization tool, and full documentation.


# Features

The luax programming language itself:
 + easy-to-learn: it inherits lua's simple and decent syntax
 + powerful data description constructs
 + encapsulation: avoid implicit global namespace pollution

The C achieve of luax:
 + using subset of c++ and c: show you low-layer resource management technology
 + full-documented: covered from design to implementation, a good guide to learn modern compiler&amp;interpreter
